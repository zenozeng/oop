# OOP

My OOP Homework at ZJU.

I use [cldoc](http://jessevdk.github.io/cldoc/documenting.html) as my documentation generator.

I use doxygen as my documentation generator.  And I use [this theme](https://github.com/nnen/doxygen-theme).

I use clang++ as my compiler. Make sure you have libclang1 installed, if you want to generate doc.

The Code is Licensed under `GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3`.

It's okay to reference these code, but you should __never copy homework__.

And great thanks to @richard1122!
